        <p class="about-text">
          At UCLA, there is often a disconnect between decision-makers, and
          those who are affected by their decisions. BruinSpeak allows for any
          student at UCLA to create proposals for changes that they would like
          to see on campus, as well as to voice their opinions about existing
          proposals. The desire is for student government organizations UCLA
          management to use this as a resource to see the changes that students
          are passionate about.
